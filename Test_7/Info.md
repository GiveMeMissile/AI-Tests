This test compares the usage of a custom loss function (supervised learning/CL) and Reinforcement learning (RL).
This test utilizes pygame as the enviorment. The main goal of the AI model is to collide with a white square which is either controlled by a player or randomness.
The AI controls one or more red squares by chosing which direction the square will go in. This test will also compare the preformance of different types of AI models.
Such as the preformance of LSTMs and Transformer model architecture.
