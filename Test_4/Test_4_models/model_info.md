The first 4 models were from both the baseline and rnn tests. They were trained in 100 epochs and both reached a final accuracy of 73%.
Yet the rnn model reached this goal within 3 epoch while the other models took much longer. This causes me to change the test number of epoch from 100 to 5 for better results.
