These models are split between two types of models. Models pretrained in part 1 or models saved after the completetion of a different part. 
model001, 004, 005 are pretrained in pretrained in part 1, model 002, 003, and 006 are saved after the end of a part. 
All models saved with part one was done so for 500 epochs and all had an final accuracy of arounf 72%.
All the other models that were not pretrained on part 1 were saved due to there exeptional preformance and were saved before the models regressed into a worse form.
