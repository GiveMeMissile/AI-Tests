This test uses pygame in order to compare similar AI models together.
I have the AI models track down a small cube and each AI model controls their own cube.
When an AI's cube comes into contact with the target cube the AI model gains a point.
I use this in order to compare models that are slightly different from each other.
Such as a model that has a higher number of hidden units than another.
This is just a fun way to compare the importance of different aspects of an AI model.
The final part, part 6, is an amalgamation of all the previous parts and is the best to see the overall result of this test.
