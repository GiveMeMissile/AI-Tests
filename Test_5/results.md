The results of using randomly generated images was rather intereting. 
In the first 2 epoch the model had began to improve on the test accuracy being between 61%-63% for both epoch.
Yet it had a high loss being between 6400-6800 and the train accuracy was rather low being 51%-60%.
The model eventually in the last 3 epoch of the 5 total epochs began making large strides in the train accuracy gaining 99% accuracy in the final epoch.
Yet the Test accuracy plummeted down to 45% in the last epoch.
So while using generated images worked for a bit as the model progressed on the training its effectiveness in the testing department plummeted.
So overall using generated images can be useful one must not rely on it and should find real images rather than using randomly generated ones.
