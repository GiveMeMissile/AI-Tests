This test is ment to test the usage of images created via randomly generated tensors in training an Neural Network.
The images generated will be compared to images of fish to see if training the Neural Network can learn to seperate an image of a fish to an image of a non-fish 
if trained on this generated data and the dataset.
This test will make use of the Bad_data dataset for testing and the huggingface dataset, (https://huggingface.co/datasets/copycat-project/laion2b6plus_fish), 
alongside generated images for training.
